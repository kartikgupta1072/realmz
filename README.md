Realmz is a classic, turn-based RPG, originally developed for early Macintosh computers. It was originally released as shareware, with additional scenarios available for purchase. Tim has graciously agreed to a release of the original code under a non-commercial license (see "License" section below).

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please review the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Realmz-Castle/realmz?tab=contributing-ov-file) in full, but to summarize:

- Only PRs that advance the project's goals of preservation and authenticity will be accepted.
- AI-assisted code is acceptable, but must be human reviewed by you before you submit for maintainer review.
- When modifying code under `src/realmz_org`, please include comments indicating the changes from the original
  implementation ([example](https://github.com/Realmz-Castle/realmz/blob/fc143ecb7d54b1f7be3ff7e714fea450297b8bb9/src/realmz_orig/warn.c#L61)).

## Building on Mac

- Download dependencies as git submodules
  - `git submodule init`
  - Download external dependencies of SDL_ttf `vendored/SDL_ttf/external/download.sh`
- Download and install [phosg](https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/phosg) (commit [b2e0c12edb7e274a5e20c460f44eee44f49f57ef](https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/phosg/tree/b2e0c12edb7e274a5e20c460f44eee44f49f57ef)) and [resource_dasm](https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/resource_dasm) (commit [27f64c89a5fed855e68c2a5e97b6c6c389d8eb19](https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/resource_dasm/tree/27f64c89a5fed855e68c2a5e97b6c6c389d8eb19)). Make sure to compile with `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="x86_64;arm64"` in order to build Realmz as a fat binary that can run on both architectures. Also use `-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.3` to make sure all dependencies and Realmz are targeting the same minimum MacOS SDK.
- `cmake --preset macOS`
- `cmake --build --preset macOS`

## Cross-compiling for Windows from Mac

- Install [llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw)
  - Download latest llvm-mingw-$DATE-ucrt-macos-universal.tar.xz
  - Extract the archive
  - `sudo mv ~/Downloads/llvm-mingw-$DATE-ucrt-macos-universal /opt/llvm-mingw`
- Install NSIS for installer generation `brew install nsis`
- Create a [toolchain file](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Cross%20Compiling%20With%20CMake.html#toolchain-files)
- Clone and build phosg, resource_dasm, and zlib dependencies and install to ~/mingw-install
  - `cmake --fresh -B build -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/workspace/TC-mingw.cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/mingw-install -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`
- Set up a CMake build directory for windows using the toolchain file
  - `VERBOSE=1 cmake -B build_win -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON -DSDLTTF_VENDORED=ON -DDISABLE_SDL:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/TC-mingw.cmake`
- Build for windows using llvm-mingw `cmake --build build_win --target package`
